    <h1>Pictures By John</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>John</strong> and photography is my passion. I
      have been exposed to cameras and the act of saving memories with photos
      from a very early age, as I reached adulthood I developed the skill as a
      prominent feature of my enjoyed activites. I have taken a few introductory
      courses in the subject but mostly I practice the art as frequently as I
      can use my skills more serious for personal and professional reasons. For
      now the only outlet for my pictures is found here on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/picturesbyJon">my twitter</a>.
